# What is it
pretty simple and straightforward (I hope) wrapper around the mprime binary 
 
# Why does it exist 
I wanted a way to programatically interface with mprime, python seemed the
sensible choice

# requirements
mprime binary, should be available via your package manager 
  Archlinux - `aurman -S mprime`
